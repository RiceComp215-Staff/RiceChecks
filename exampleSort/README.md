# RiceChecks: exampleSort
In this hypothetical project, students are asked to implement three sorting algorithms;
their work is tested with [QuickTheories](https://github.com/quicktheories/QuickTheories),
generating hundreds of random inputs.

To play with this outside of the RiceChecks codebase, check out the standalone version of this project:
