# RiceChecks: standaloneSort
In this hypothetical project, students are asked to implement three sorting algorithms;
their work is tested with [QuickTheories](https://github.com/quicktheories/QuickTheories),
generating hundreds of random inputs.

The [build.gradle](build.gradle) file here is a suitable starting point for integrating RiceChecks
into other projects.
