# RiceChecks: standaloneSort
In this hypothetical project, students are asked to implement three sorting algorithms;
their work is tested with [QuickTheories](https://github.com/quicktheories/QuickTheories),
generating hundreds of random inputs.

To play with this outside of the RiceChecks codebase, check out the standalone version of this project:
- https://github.com/RiceComp215-Staff/RiceChecks-SortExample

That standalone version is set up to use Java11. The [build.gradle](build.gradle) file here 
is a suitable starting point for integrating RiceChecks into projects using Java8.
