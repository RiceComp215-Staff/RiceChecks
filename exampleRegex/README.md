# RiceChecks: exampleRegex

In this hypothetical project, students are asked to implement several regular expressions;
their work is tested using JUnit5's [TestFactory](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.4.0/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/TestFactory.html),
which has a list of examples for each regex that should be accepted and another list
of examples that should be rejected by the regex.

To play with this outside of the RiceChecks codebase, check out the standalone version of this project:
