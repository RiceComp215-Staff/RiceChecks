# RiceChecks: exampleRegex

In this hypothetical project, students are asked to implement several regular expressions;
their work is tested using JUnit5's [TestFactory](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.4.0/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/TestFactory.html),
which has a list of examples for each regex that should be accepted and another list
of examples that should be rejected by the regex.
